## BMI Script
While there are many tools, websites & apps which calculate your BMI based on I wanted to have a tool 
which provided more information.

This script will ask a user to confirm their height (in meters) & weight (in KG). It will then provide 
the following information to the user:
- Their current BMI
- Their current BMI category (underweight, healthy, overweight, obese)
- If the user falls into underweight it will display how much they need to gain to get into healthy
- If the user falls into overweight it will display how much they need to lose to get into healthy
- If the user falls into obese it will display how much weight they need to lose to get into both the overweight
category and also into healthy
- Finally, the script displays a table of the weight ranges for their given height. This is based on 
the following information

        If your BMI is less than 18.5, it falls within the underweight range.
        If your BMI is 18.5 to 24.9, it falls within the normal or Healthy Weight range.
        If your BMI is 25.0 to 29.9, it falls within the overweight range.
        If your BMI is 30.0 or higher, it falls within the obese range.
